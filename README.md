Hi, I’m Floop

I've recently embarked on the journey of learning to build front end experiences that provide not only a user interface 
  but also an intricate digital story told in an artful often animated way.
  
I'm currently learning to use GSAP and Scrollmagic for the afforementioned life quest. 

Prior to now I have worked mostly as an NFT project dev building metadata apis, front ends, image compilation scripts, and smart contracts. 
  In addition to that I also enjoy writing my own Ethereum scripts using the Brownie framework.
  
I am always open to new projects and love learning so feel free to contact me :)
